# constellations

This repository contains descriptions of constellations of mutations for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

A *constellation* is a collection of mutations which are functionally meaningful, but which may arise independently a number of times.

Here we include files that define:

- lineages of concern - for these lineages, the defining mutations have been extracted so that individual sequences can be classified deterministically
- genomically interesting regions e.g. RBD sites which interact with ACE2

In addition we include a JSON file describing the reference sequence and the coordinates of genes/proteins. Mutations can therefore be described with respect to the amino acid position within these features.
